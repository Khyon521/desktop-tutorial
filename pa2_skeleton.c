this was before i realized I had to break the code into 2 pieces. 
The Mobile version of Github won't delete it so heres this random quote I found online. 
"true knowledge exists in knowing that you know nothing, and knowing the pursuit will never end is the first step in the pursuit of knowledge"
and that knowledge has led me to these 3 questions?

you ever realize how we bake cookies and cook bacon?

how we call packages transported on ships cargo, but call packages delivered by car/van shipments?

most importantly why do the last 4 months of the year have mismatched prefix placements.  sept=7, Octo=8, Nov/Nona=9,Dec/Deca=10. 
so why are they 9,10,11,12...
